# First Published Game

We are merely a couple of students from Russia, striving in the industry,
trying to deliver something to the world of game development, and we are
finally very close on our way of publishing a game.

Just after the gamejam (or at the time of the event) we will update the
website of the game, located at <https://www.spacebattle.online>.

# Space Battle Online

It is the game! You will be playing as a space ship among many other
players, trying to survive in this Sci-Fi cosmic world.

I won't spoil it for you. Just wait for it, it's coming very soon ;)
