# Apologies

The last post was made almost three months ago. It has been hard for me to work on the project and live a life. Don't get me wrong,
I am making progress in developing the game, but it's taking a very long time to do everything. The game needs a good UI/UX
design, but I am not an expert in the area, not at all. It was a lot easier in my head, but it seems that coming up with
comfortable controls for an LRTS game in 3D space is quite difficult. I don't think anyone actually reads these posts,
but if you do â€” thank you.

P.S. At some point I realised that I am actually working on the game alone, so there's no point in 'we' anymore.

# What Has Been Done

I have created a basic client with a very basic main menu which allows creating matches and joining them.
I've also made a simple scene with all the world points and players spawned, right now they have a look
of simple colored cubes, which will then be replaced by some actual game models (which I also don't have).

You can always check out what stage I am on and what problems I am solving at the moment
in my [Trello](https://trello.com/b/HfwEgAHQ/space-battle-20) board. Hop on!

# Stay Tuned

We'd love to know you keep an eye on me.

Stay home. Stay safe.

Good Luck!
