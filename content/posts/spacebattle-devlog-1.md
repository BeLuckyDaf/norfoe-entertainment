# We've Been Busy

It has been so long since the last post, and you have to know: we were not procrastinating. Hard work
and effort has been put into Space Battle's ongoing development. We want to make sure that the product
we release won't be a one-day check out and move on kind of game.

Almost all forces were sent to fight the demons of networking, we tried several solutions for
game backend and after a few unsuccessful attempts, decided to stay with [HeroicLabs' Nakama](https://heroiclabs.com).
These guys are doing an awesome job, and we couldn't leave them uncredited.

# Track Us!

You can always check out what stage we are on and what problems we are solving at the moment,
we use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/HfwEgAHQ/space-battle-20) to track our progress and the board is publicly available. Hop on!

# So, when?

We'd really like to say that the game is coming out tomorrow, but that wouldn't be true,
there's still a lot of work. Remember, we want this to be a fun to play competitive
multiplayer game in space.

At some point we will roll with beta testing, and for that, we're going to need all
of you, people. There will be a lot of balancing to manage.

During the testing, we will accept suggestions on what we could add into the game,
could be anything.

# Stay Tuned

We'd love to know you keep an eye on us.

Stay home. Stay safe.

Good Luck!
