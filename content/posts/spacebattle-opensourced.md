# Open Source

We've open sourced the GGJ version of the client, and the server has always been on GitHub.
If you think you want to try something of your own in our game, go get it!

Have fun!

# Hold on...

In the meanwhile, we're working on Space Battle ver. 2.0, there will be a better server with better netcode,
and a better client with better UI. We'll keep you updated, there are not going to be only technical changes,
the gameplay will change a lot too, we'll set up some more features and opportunities.

Stand by.
